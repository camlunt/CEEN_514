I am really excited for this class!
I hope to become familiar with web programming--how to do it and how to collaborate with others effectively and efficiently.
I hope to work in transportation data analysis, so I expect this course to prove useful to me. 
I think this is going to be my favorite class this semester!

Some interesting facts about our project:
1. All three students on the project are hoping to work in the transportation field.
2. The idea stemmed from a project Emily worked on during her summer internship. Looking back, she realized the analysis could have been performed much quicker with the use of ArcGIS Pro.
3. It took us more than 2 days to come up with our team name (Go On Green).
4. We are considering using the ArcGIS Pro Least Cost Path tool to help us with our analysis.
4. We are planning on creating a map in the output of our web-app that will look sort of like a heat map to show the overall connectivity of a specified city.
